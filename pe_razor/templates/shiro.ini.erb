# Configure Shiro to authenticate using user, password, and role data from the
# ini file. The credentials matcher is used to authenticate connecting users,
# where a user is specified by their username and password. SHA-256 is used by
# default, so all passwords listed here must be SHA-256 hashes. To calculate the
# SHA-256 of a password, you can use openssl via. the following CLI invocation:
#   echo -n <password> | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | xxd -p -c 256
#
# NOTE: The "-n" flag forces echo not to append a newline, as otherwise
# it would be hashed along with <password>!
#
# See http://shiro.apache.org/configuration.html for the full documentation on
# how this configuration file can express Shiro authentication and
# role configuration.
[main]

# We need to declare the sha256Matcher variable here so that Shiro
# actually creates the object
sha256Matcher = org.apache.shiro.authc.credential.Sha256CredentialsMatcher
iniRealm.credentialsMatcher = $sha256Matcher 

[users]
# define users known to shiro and, thus, razor:
# <username> = <password>, <role>[, <role>...]
#
# You specify roles as a command separated list, following the password; a
# user can be associated with an unlimited number of roles.
#
# See http://shiro.apache.org/configuration.html#Configuration-%5Cusers%5C for
# more details.
#
# We still don't recommend using local file storage for authentication
# information even if the passwords are encrypted.
